SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is a programming language for relational databases - meaning databates which have rows and columns.

WHAT IS NOSQL?

WHAT IS A PRIMARY KEY?

A primary key is a unique identifier that ensures that each value in a database is a unique value. It is often set to the id, autoincementing and it can not be NULL.

WHAT IS A FOREIGN KEY?

A foreign key is a uniquie identifier in a second table that is connected to the primary key in the first table. This allows you to connect two tables together and compare values.

WHAT IS NORMALIZATION?

Normalization is a organizing and structuring technique for databases, that reduces redundancy and ensures data integrity. It is based on the idea of First Normal Form, Second Normal Form and Third Normal form.

WHAT ARE CONSTRAINTS IN SQL?

Constraints are rules on conditions applied to a column in SQL for the purpose of data integrity and accuracy. They put restriction on what type of data can be inserted, updated, deleted from the table.

WHAT IS A VIEW IN SQL?

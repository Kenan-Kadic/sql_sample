DETAILS ON RELATIONAL DATABASES AND SQL

WHAT IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE?
A relational database organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. The goal is to have structured and efficient ways to store and retreive data. Each row in a table represents a record, while each column represents a specific attribute of that record.

A TABLE IS A MAIN STRUCTURE OF A RELATIONAL DATABASE.

EACH ROW represents a single record or entry in the database.

COLUMS represent that attributes or properties of the date stored in the database.

A PRIMARY KEY is a unique idenfitier that ensures that each row in the table is a unique value. It is most often set to the ID - auto incrementing.

A FOREIGN KEY is a idenfitier in one table that is the connected to the primary key in another table. It creates relationships between two tables. It allows you to connected them.

NORMALIZATION is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller much more managable ones.
